# Multiple Linear Regression Quiz

# 3.3.R1

Suppose we are interested in learning about a relationship between X_1 and Y, which we would ideally like to interpret as causal.

True or False? The estimate \hat\beta_1 in a linear regression that controls for many variables (that is, a regression with many predictors in addition to X_1) is usually a more reliable measure of a causal relationship than \hat\beta_1 from a univariate regression on X_1.

- True
- **False**
