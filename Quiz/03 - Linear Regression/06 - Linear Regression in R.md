## 3.R.R1

What is the difference between lm(y ~ x*z) and lm(y ~ I(x*z)), when x and z are both numeric variables?

- The first one includes an interaction term between x and z, whereas the second uses the product of x and z as a predictor in the model.
- The second one includes an interaction term between x and z, whereas the first uses the product of x and z as a predictor in the model.
- The first includes only an interaction term for x and z, while the second includes both interaction effects and main effects.
- **The second includes only an interaction term for x and z, while the first includes both interaction effects and main effects.**
