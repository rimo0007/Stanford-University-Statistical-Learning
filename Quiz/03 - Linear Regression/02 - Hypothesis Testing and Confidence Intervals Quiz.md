# Hyphotesis Testing and Confidence Invervals Quiz

## 3.2.R1

We run a linear regression and the slope estimate is 0.5 with estimated standard error of 0.2. What is the largest value of  for which we would NOT reject the null hypothesis that \beta_1=b? (assume normal approximation to t distribution, and that we are using the 5% significance level for a two-sided test; need two significant digits of accuracy)

**0.892**

## 3.2.R2

Which of the following indicates a fairly strong relationship between X and Y?

- **R^2 = 0.9**
- The p-value for the null hypothesis \beta_1=0 is 0.0001
- The t-statistic for the null hypothesis \beta_1=0 is 30
