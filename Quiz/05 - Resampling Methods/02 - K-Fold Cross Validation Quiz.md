# K-Fold Cross Validation Quiz

## 5.2.R1

Suppose we want to use cross-validation to estimate the error of the following procedure:

Step 1: Find the k variables most correlated with y

Step 2: Fit a linear regression using those variables as predictors

We will estimate the error for each k from 1 to p, and then choose the best k.

True or false: a correct cross-validation procedure will possibly choose a different set of k variables for every fold.

- **TRUE**
- FALSE
