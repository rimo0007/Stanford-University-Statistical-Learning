# Cross-Validation Quiz

## 5.1.R1

When we fit a model to data, which is typically larger?

- **Test Error**
- Training Error

## 5.1.R2

What are reasons why test error could be LESS than training error?

- **By chance, the test set has easier cases than the training set.**
- The model is highly complex, so training error systematically overestimates test error
- The model is not very complex, so training error systematically overestimates test error
