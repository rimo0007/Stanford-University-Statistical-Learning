# Stepwise Selection Quiz

## 6.2.R1

We perform best subset and forward stepwise selection on a single dataset. For both approaches, we obtain  models, containing  predictors.

Which of the two models with  predictors is guaranteed to have training RSS no larger than the other model?

- **Best Subset**
- Forward Stepwise
- They always have the same training RSS
- Not enough information is given to know

## 6.2.R2

Which of the two models with  predictors has the smallest test RSS?

- Best Subset
- Forward Stepwise
- They always have the same test RSS
- **Not enough information is given to know**
