# Shrinkage Methods and Ridge Regression Quiz

## 6.6.R1

\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_j^2} is equivalent to:

- X\hat\beta
- \hat\beta^R
- C_p statistic
- **\|\beta\|_2**

## 6.6.R2

You perform ridge regression on a problem where your third predictor, x3, is measured in dollars. You decide to refit the model after changing x3 to be measured in cents. Which of the following is true?:

- \hat\beta_3 and \hat y will remain the same.
- \hat\beta_3 will change but \hat y will remain the same.
- \hat\beta_3 will remain the same but \hat y will change.
- **\hat\beta_3 and \hat y will both change.**
