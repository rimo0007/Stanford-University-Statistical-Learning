# Validation and Cross-Validation

## 6.5.R1

You are doing a simulation in order to compare the effect of using Cross-Validation or a Validation set. For each iteration of the simulation, you generate new data and then use both Cross-Validation and a Validation set in order to determine the optimal number of predictors. Which of the following is most likely?

- The Cross-Validation method will result in a higher variance of optimal number of predictors
- **The Validation set method will result in a higher variance of optimal number of predictors**
- Both methods will produce results with the same variance of optimal number of predictors
- Not enough information is given to decide
