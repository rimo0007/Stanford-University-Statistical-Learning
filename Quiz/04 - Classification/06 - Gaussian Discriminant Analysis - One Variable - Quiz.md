# Gaussian Discriminant Analysis - One Variable Quiz

# 4.6.R1

Which of the following is NOT a linear function in x:

- f(x) = a + b^2x
- The discriminant function from LDA
- \delta_k(x) = x\frac{\mu_k}{\sigma^2} - \frac{\mu_k^2}{2\sigma^2} +\log(\pi_k)
- \text{logit}(P(y = 1 | x)) where P(y=1 | x) is as in logistic regression
- P(y=1 | x) from logistic regression
