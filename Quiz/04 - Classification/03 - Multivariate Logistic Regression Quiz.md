# Multivariate Logistic Regression Quiz

## 4.3.R1

Suppose we collect data for a group of students in a statistics class with variables X_1 hours studied, X_2 undergrad GPA, and Y= receive an A. We fit a logistic regression and produce estimated coefficients \hat\beta_o = -6, \hat\beta_1 = 0.05, \hat\beta_2 = 1.

Estimate the probability that a student who studies for 40h and has an undergrad GPA of 3.5 gets an A in the class (within 0.01 accuracy):

**0.3775**

## 4.3.R2

How many hours would that student need to study to have a 50% chance of getting an A in the class?:

**50**
